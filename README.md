# Splash-That
Small project to demonstrate using Python with Selenium WebDriver
In v2 added negative login test case.

It contains two test cases:
1. Login with valid user and verify. Log out.
2. Login with invalid user and verify error pops up. (Since there is no addition login validation done by the website, only one test case needed. It always checks if login credentials exist or not and throws error message if not.)
